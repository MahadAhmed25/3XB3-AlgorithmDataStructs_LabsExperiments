# McMaster University - SFWRENG 3XB3:Software Engineering Practice and Experience: Binding Theory to Practice

## Instructor: Vincent Maccio

Welcome to the repository for the SFWRENG 3XB3 course, taught by Professor Vincent Maccio. This repository serves as a showcase for the outstanding work completed by me and my 2 lab partners during the course, specifically focusing on four challenging labs that cover various advanced topics in algorithms.

### Labs Overview

#### Lab 1: Sorting Algorithms
In this lab, we explore different sorting algorithms to understand their efficiency and trade-offs. The exercises involve implementing and analyzing classic sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and QuickSort. The goal is to gain a deeper insight into the inner workings of these algorithms and their applications in real-world scenarios.

#### Lab 2: Graphs and Graph Algorithms
Lab 2 dives into the fascinating world of graphs and graph algorithms. We will implement and analyze fundamental graph algorithms, including breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS) and shortest path algorithms. The lab also covers essential graph concepts and explores their practical applications.

#### Lab 3: Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is the focus of Lab 3, where we tackle problems that require breaking down complex tasks into simpler subproblems. The lab involves implementing dynamic programming solutions and analyzing their efficiency. Topics covered include optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.

#### Lab 4: Dynamic Programming and Graphs
Building upon the concepts learned in previous labs, Lab 4 combines dynamic programming and graph algorithms. we work on problems that require a combination of both techniques, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these advanced algorithms can be applied synergistically.
